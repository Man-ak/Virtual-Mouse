# Virtual Mouse using Hand Gestures

A Python application that uses computer vision and hand tracking to create a virtual mouse control. This project utilizes OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI to detect hand gestures and control the mouse cursor accordingly.

## Features

- Detects hand gestures in real-time.
- Controls the mouse cursor using hand movements.
- Simulates left-click mouse events based on finger positions.
- Customizable thresholds for gesture recognition.
- Supports both Python 2 and Python 3.
